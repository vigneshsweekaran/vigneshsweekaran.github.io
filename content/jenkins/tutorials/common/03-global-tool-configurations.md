# Global Tool Configurations

In linux servers, we can install only one version of the tool at a time eg: we can install only maven 3.6 and we cannot have both maven 3.6 and 3.7 in same server.

By configuring **Global Tool configuration**, we can have multiple version of maven, nodejs, gradle, java and ant

### How to configure multiple versions of maven
From Jenkins dashboard, click on **Manage Jenkins**

##### How to use this maven in Jenkinsfile
```
tools {
    maven 'maven-3.6.3'
}
```
**maven-3.6.3** is the unique name which we have given in the global tool configurations.

When we use maven for first time by referring to this name and run the job, jenkins will automatically download the maven tar file, extract and save it in **/var/lib/jenkins/tools/** folder

From the next build it will use the maven from that folder, it won't download everytime

**nodejs-10.0.0** is the unique name which we have given in the global tool configurations.

When we use nodejs for first time by referring to this name and run the job, jenkins will automatically download the mnodejs tar file, extract and save it in **/var/lib/jenkins/tools/** folder
