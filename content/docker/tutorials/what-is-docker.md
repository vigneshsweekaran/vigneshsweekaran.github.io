## What is Docker

### Physical server to Virtual Machines

We have a big physical server 512 GB memory and 10TB storage

Using `hypervisor` technology we can create multiple virtual machines from physical server with different capacity

* Virtual machine - 1 with memory 4GB, storage 100 GB and operating system Ubuntu 23.04
* Virtual machine - 2 with memory 4GB, storage 200 GB and operating system Oracle linux 9.2
* Virtual machine - 3 with memory 16GB, storage 200 GB and operating system windows 11

### Virtual Machine in detail

Here we can see 2 virtual machines are created,

* Virtual machine - 1 with memory 16GB, storage 200 GB and operating system windows 11. On top of that Java 11, maven 3.6 and Tomcat 9 Web server application is installed

* Virtual machine - 2 with memory 8GB, storage 100 GB and operating system Ubuntu 23.04. On top of that Java 17, maven 3.8 and Jenkins CI/CD application is installed

### Why we need to create multiple virtual machines from Physical server.

Isolation on Dependencies, application, project, Networking, security

* Project-A wants Java 11, Maven 3.6 and Tomcat web server version 8
* Project-B wants Java 17, Maven 3.8 and Tomcat application version 9
* Project-C wants NodeJS 20, and Nginx web server version 1.25

Thinking on setting up CI/CD applications

You want to set up ci/cd applications like Jenkins, SonarQube, Jfrog artifactory

You are using old version of Jenkins application and it will support only on Java 11

You are using latest version of SonarQube 10.1 with requires minimum Java 17

### Where docker comes into picture here ?

Docker is another isolation within the virtual machine

Within the Virtual machine, you can create multiple docker containers, which are isolated from each other.

Application dependencies are packaged within the docker container, no need to install in Virtual machine.

In virtual machine, only docker needs to be installed
