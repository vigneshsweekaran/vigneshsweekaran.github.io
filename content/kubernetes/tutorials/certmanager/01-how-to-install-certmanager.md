## How to install/uninstall cert-manager in kubernetes

### What is cert-manager in kubernetes ?
Cert-manager is a agent/tool running on kubernetes to get/renew TLS certificates automatically from the configured CA Authority.

Cert-manager will not be installed by default in kubernetes cluster. 

We have to install explicitly using helm chart or using kubernetes manifest file

### How to install cert-manager
##### Using Kubernetes Manifest file

[Official Documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/)

By default cert-manager will be deployed in `cert-manager` namespace.

We no need to explicitly create the `cert-manager` namespace. Its alreday defined as part of manifest file

All required resources for cert-manager are defined in the single manifest file.

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

##### Using Helm chart

[Official Documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/)

Add the Jetstack Helm repository
```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
```

To install the cert-manager Helm chart
```
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.4.0 \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

We no need to explicitly create the `cert-manager` namespace, it will be automatically created by passing this argument `--create-namespace` to helm install command.

### Verify cert-manager installation

```
kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager
```
`Output`
```

```

Create an Issuer to test the webhook works okay.

Create a file called `test-resources.yaml` and paste the following

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: cert-manager-test
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: test-selfsigned
  namespace: cert-manager-test
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-cert
  namespace: cert-manager-test
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - example.com
  secretName: selfsigned-cert-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: test-selfsigned
```

Create the test resources.
```
kubectl apply -f test-resources.yaml
```

Check the status of the newly created certificate. You may need to wait a few seconds before cert-manager processes the certificate request.

```
kubectl describe certificate -n cert-manager-test
```

Clean up the test resources.

```
kubectl delete -f test-resources.yaml
```

### Uninstall cert-manager

Before uninstalling cert-manager, verify whether the resources created by cert-manager are deleted.

```
kubectl get Issuers,ClusterIssuers,Certificates,CertificateRequests,Orders,Challenges --all-namespaces
```

##### Using Manifest file

Delete the installation manifests using a link to your currently running version vX.Y.Z

`https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/cert-manager.yaml`

I have installed `1.4.0` lets replace `vX.Y.Z` with `v1.4.0`

```
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

##### Using Helm

Uninstall the helm release and delete the `cert-manager` namespace
```
helm --namespace cert-manager delete cert-manager
kubectl delete namespace cert-manager
```

Finally, delete the cert-manger CustomResourceDefinitions using the link to the version vX.Y.Z you installed: `https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/cert-manager.crds.yaml`

I have installed `1.4.0` lets replace `vX.Y.Z` with `v1.4.0`
```
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```
