## Load balancer

### Notes
* The pricing for a Standard load balancer is based on the number of rules configured (load balancer rules and NAT rules) and data processed. However, there is no hourly charge for the Standard load balancer itself when no rules are configured. Since this load balancer contains rules, it should be removed to save money
