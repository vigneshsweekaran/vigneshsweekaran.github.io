## Virtual Machine

###

### Notes
* Once you have created the VM, the availability zone cannot be changed
* Virtual machines with Premium SSD disks qualify for the 99.9% connectivity SLA
* Custom data - You might need to inject a script or other metadata into a Microsoft Azure virtual machine (VM) at provisioning time. Microsoft Azure calls this feature custom data. Custom data is made available to the VM during first startup or setup, which is called provisioning. Provisioning is the process where VM creation parameters (for example, host name, username, password, certificates, custom data, and keys) are made available to the VM.
