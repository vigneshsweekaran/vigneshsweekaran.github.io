### Notes
* service shared access signature (SAS) - A service SAS delegates access to a resource in just one of the storage services: the Blob, Queue, Table, or File service. However, you aren't able to create a service SAS from within the Azure portal, only via REST API
* shared access signature (SAS) - A shared access signature (SAS) allows you to have granular control over your storage account, including access to only certain services (i.e. Azure Blobs) and permitting only read, write, delete, list, add, or create access
* stored access policy - A stored access policy allows granular control over a single storage container using a shared access signature (SAS)
