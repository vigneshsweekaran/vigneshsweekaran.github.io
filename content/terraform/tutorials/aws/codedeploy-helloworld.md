# Terraform script to create AWS Codedeploy

**Terraform Script :** [Github](https://github.com/vigneshsweekaran/terraform/tree/main/aws/08-codedeploy/hello-world)

**Terraform script creates the following**
* AWS EC2 instance and install the codedeploy agent
* Roles
* AWS Codedeploy application
* AWS codedeploy deployment group

**Code deploy**
** Install docker if not preset
** Check if docker service is running or not
** Stops the old docker container if running
** Creates new docker container with new docker image
** Validates if newly created docker container is running or not

Codedeploy deployment has to be triggered manually once the above resources are created by terraform script
